## About Me

## Introduction
Here you'll find projects and code related to my studies, personal projects, and maybe some fun experiments. I'm passionate about software development and constantly learning new technologies to enhance my skills, but my big passion is game development.

## Projects
- [**The Way Of The Guardians**]: The Way Of The Guardians is a work of the RPG genre that captures the essence of the "heroic journey". The story is crafted around the theme of "redemption", featuring an intriguing mythology and capivating characters. Players are introduced to the Four Guardians, each representing one of the four primordial elements - fire, water, earth and air - and are tasked with protecting the world from a imminent threat.

- [**You, Who Taught Me How To Love**]: Tells the story of the emotional journey of an nameless immortal warrior, who witnesses the ups and downs of her world's history over centuries. After a terrible battle, the nameless warrior is cursed with immortality and what seemed to be a blessing, soon turns out to be the worst of the curses, as she lives through different eras, repeatedly meeting her mortal friends and facing different challenges..

- [**Gazing Upon The Stars**]: So I've had several game projects around my life, most of which I've created scripts (well, several scripts). But currently I am working on a game uising elements of history (such as historical, mythical and even figures from fables), astronomy and the universe as a whole, all wrapped up in a apocalyptic scenario with a plot full of twists, but for now... it's just the story script and the name.
